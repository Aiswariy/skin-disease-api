# skin-disease-api
This aims to develop a Skin Disease Detection System using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to classify various skin diseases from images and provide accurate predictions. The system is integrated with a web-based interface where users can upload images of skin conditions to receive real-time disease detection results.

Web page created with Visual Studio Code which captures real time images as well as it supports upload features(app.py and index.html).
